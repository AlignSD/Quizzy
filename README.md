## User Story

Hey! I'm Evan Alioto. I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCSD Extension. I've always had the desire to learn how to code but never had anyone around me to help direct me, so I decided to just jump straight into it. So far I've been having a blast and the content I've been learning has helped affirm my desires to get into coding. My goals with all of this is to switch careers in order to pursue something I'm passionate about. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page and please don't be afraid to reach out! Thank you for your time.

## Description

My homework for this week was to create a Quizz. I wasn't able to fully finish it but I got most of the framework done. Some of the issues I ran into were getting the timer to stop if I clicked the last answer, Getting local storage to store the initials and score and then pulling those values on the high score page, figuring out a better way to switch between question sets.
I learned a-lot from this weeks homework though which is an accomplishment in iteself. JavaScript has been quite the formidable foe for me.
